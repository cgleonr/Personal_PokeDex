# Personal PokeDex

I hope nintendo doesn't come after me for this one.

## What is this??

"Personal PokeDex" Aims to emulate the pokedex found in (as far as I can remember) the original Pokemon show. The goal is to be able to look up all the information about all the released pokemon, and display it in a friendly way. This also includes type strengths and weaknesses, information that I myself usually tend to look for when heading into battles underlevelled :thumbsup:.

## What does it look like?
